### Manual Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React:
 A minimal SSR setup for React using Node.js and Babel, without a framework like Next.js, to learn how SSR works under the hood.

### What It Does

-   Server-side rendering in server.js using renderToString

-   Hydration with client.js in the browser

-   Babel compilation via @babel/register to run JSX on the server

### Tech Stack

-   React: Components and state

-   Node.js: HTTP server

-   Babel: Transpiles JSX to JavaScript

-   No build tools: Live transpilation with @babel/register
